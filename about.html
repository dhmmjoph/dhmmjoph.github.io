 <p class="about">
 	Hi, I'm <b>John Holbrook</b>. I do lots of things, but these days I'm mostly a student at 
 	<a href="http://ohio.edu">Ohio University</a> in Athens, Ohio, where I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
 	(I have <a href="http://cs.ohio.edu/~jholbroo/">a page</a> on the Ohio U. CS Department web server with 
 	more information about my academic persuits.)
 </p>

<p class="about">
	I'm particularly interested in educational robotics competitions, and much of my spare time is spent volunteering
	at educational robotics events, including <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST LEGO League</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/">VEX Robotics Competition</a>, and 
	<a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexiq/competition/vex-iq-challenge-overview">VEX IQ Challenge</a> events.
	I mostly volunteer at events organized by the <a href="http://wvroboticsalliance.org/">West Virginia Robotics
	Alliance</a>, though I also help out with a few VRC events in Ohio when time allows. 
</p>

<p class="about">
	I grew up racing sailboats in the summer months. During the summers of 2015-2018, I worked as an instructor 
	at the <a href="http://www.orleansyachtclub.org/sailing/junior-sailing-program">Orleans Yacht Club Junior Sailing 
	Program</a> in Orleans, Massachusetts, where I helped to instruct children ages 8-18 in sailing, 
	from beginner to advanced levels. From 2012 to 2016, I was also a member of the program's 420 race team.
</p>

<p class="about">
	I'm also involved with Ohio University's <a href="https://twitter.com/ohiosailing">student-run club sailing team</a>.
	For calendar year 2019, I am the team's Fleet Captain &amp; Safety Officer, with responsibility for equipment maintenance
	and member safety during practices and regattas. I previously filled this role in calendar year 2017. In 2018, I was the
	team's President &amp; Commodore, overseeing the team's operation and ensuring compliance with university and conference
	rules.
</p>

 <p class="about">I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, where in 2016 I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington_High_School_(West_Virginia)">Huntington High School</a>. While there, I helped found the school's VEX Robotics Competition and Science Olympiad teams.</p>

 <p class="about">There used to be a joke at the end of this bio about how pompous it was to write a bio of oneself in the third person. Now that I've rewritten the bio in the first person, that joke doesn't really fit anymore.</p>

<h2>Accountability though Embarassment</h2>
<p class="about">
	I have a nasty habit of taking too long to update the copyright date at the bottom of every page:
	<table class="table table-striped copyright-table">
		<tr>
			<th>Year</th>
			<th>Date Updated</th>
			<th>Delay</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2016</td>
			<td>July 2</td>
			<td>183 days</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2017</td>
			<td>February 26</td>
			<td>56 days</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2018</td>
			<td>February 8</td>
			<td>39 Days</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2019</td>
			<td>March 8</td>
			<td>66 Days ‚òπÔ∏è</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2020</td>
			<td>July 4</td>
			<td>185 Days üò≤</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	Hopefully I can get back on track in 2021.

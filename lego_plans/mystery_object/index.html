<!--<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
	Pairs of students use diagram reading and communications skills to reconstruct provided LEGO models.
</p>

<hr/>-->

<h3>Activity 1</h3>
<p>
	Design a simple model using normal or DUPLO bricks and model it in
	LDD or LDraw. Take screenshots of the model from front, top,
	and side perspectives. Make sure that every part on the model is visible in
	enough perspectives to reconstruct its position exactly.

</figure>
<p>
	Provide pairs of students with the parts necessary to reconstruct the model
	and a printout of the perspectives. Have students reconstruct the original
	model, looking only at the provided perspective views.
</p>

<h3>Activity 2</h3>
<p>
	Design a simple model and generate perspective views as above. Divide students into pairs. Within each pair, student A may look at the perspective
	views, but may not touch or point at the parts or the constructed model. Student B may touch, manipulate, and assemble the parts, but may not look at
	the perspective views. Thus, both students must communicate verbally to
	reconstruct the model.

<h3>Activity 3</h3>

	(This is similar to the Science Olympiad event 
	<a href="https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Write_It_Do_It"> 
	"Write it, Do it"</a>.)
</small>
<p>
	Divide students into pairs. Show a simple LEGO model to one student
	from each pair. They must write a set of "instructions" to recreate
	the model, which are limited to plain text and may not include any
	diagrams or images. These instructions are then given to their partners,
	who have not seen the reference model and must recreate it referencing only
	their partner's written instructions.

<p>
	This is a relatively simple RCX robot which is easy to build and
	suitable for a variety of applications. It's based on an old design
	by Linda Hamilton, which she detailed 
	<a href="http://www.marshall.edu/LEGO/lessonplans/Houston/RCXcar.html">here</a>.
	The .ldr file is available for download <a href="rcx_robot.ldr">here</a>.

	Key features of the robot include:
	<ul>
		<li>Four-wheel drive</li>
		<li>Simple, sturdy construction</li>
		<li>Plenty of room to mount accesory motors on the front, or sensors underneath.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

	The two drive motors form the central part of the chassis:

<p>
	Technic beams mount on the motors, providing locations to attach gears,
	sensors, ancillary motors, and other accessories:

	Several gear ratios are possible for the drive wheels. For this model,
	I chose to drive 40 tooth technic gears on all four wheels from 8
	tooth gears on the motors.

	Wheel and tire 3482 and 3634 (respectively) are a good fit for the
	40 tooth gear, and pair well with the classic look of the RCX.

	The RCX brick itself rests on the drive motors and one end 
	of the chassis:

<p>
	Lastly, the space in front of the RCX brick is a good spot to mount
	an additional motor for accessory arms. Here, I'm using another 
	RCX motor to drive two worm gear casings, providing a good place to
	easily mount and change additional manipulators.

<h3>Pythagorean Triples</h3>
<p>
	By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">
	Pythagorean Theorem</a>, all right triangles have the property that
	the sum of the squares of the two base legs' lengths is equal to
	the square of the length of the hypotenuse. This is most often
	expressed as \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the 
	lengths of the two base legs and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse.
</p>

<p>
	Positive whole number values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that 
	\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) are known as <b>pythagorean triples</b>.
	Each pythagorean triple \((a, b, c)\) corresponds to a right triangle
	with side lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
</p>

<p>
	For any pythagorean triple \((a, b, c)\), 
	\((ka, kb, kc)\) is also a pythagorean triple for any positive whole
	number k. Pythagorean triples that aren't just multiples of smaller
	pythagorean triples (in other words, pythagorean triples where 
	\(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) do not share a common factor*) are known as
	<b>primitive pythagorean triples</b>. For example, \((3,4,5)\) is a primitive pythgorean triple, since 
	3, 4, and 5 do not share a common factor*. On the other hand, 
	\((6,8,10)\) is not a primitive pythagorean triple since 6, 8, and 10
	all share a common factor of 2.
</p>

<h3>Building LEGO&reg; Right Triangles</h3>

<p>
	To better illustrate pythagorean triples, and to help in finding them,
	we can construct right triangles from LEGO&reg; elements (plates, 
	studded beams, or studless technic beams). First, attach
	the elements corresponding to the base legs at a right angle using a 
	2x3 plate or right-angular technic beam:

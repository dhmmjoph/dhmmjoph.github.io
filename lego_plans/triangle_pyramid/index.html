<h3>Triangles</h3>
<p>
	Construct a "triangle" of some reasonable hight using 2x2 LEGO bricks:
	<figure>
		<img class="embed_image" src="triangle.png"/>
		<figcaption>
			A "triangle" of height 6 constructed from 2x2 LEGO bricks
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	Count the total number of bricks in the triangle. Construct a table
	(like the one below) showing the total number of bricks in triangles
	of various heights.
	<figure>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Height</th>
				<th>Total Number of Bricks</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>

			<tr>
				<td>4</td>

<p>
	In mathematics, the total number of bricks in a triangle of height 
	<i>n</i> is called the <i>nth triangle number</i>. It could be
	calculated as: 
	$$ \sum_{i=1}^n i = 1 + 2 + \ldots + (n-1) + n $$
	In other words, layer \(i\) has \(i\) bricks, and we're adding the
	number of bricks in each layer from \(1\) to \(n\) to get the total
	number of bricks in the triangle.
</p>
<p>
	It turns out that this sum has a simple closed-form solution (that is, one 
	representable as a normal algebraic expression, without the
	summation symbol):
	$$ \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$
	Younger students could convince themselves that this is true by calculating
	\( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) for various values of \(n\) and comparing the results
	to those in the table above. More advanced mathemeticians could try to prove
	the result by induction (indeed, this is the canonical example of
	proof by induction).
</p>

<br/>

<h3>Pyramids</h3>
<p>
	We can also construct "pyramids" from 2x2 LEGO bricks:
	<figure>
		<img class="embed_image" src="pyramid.png"/>
		<figcaption>
			A "pyramid" of height 6 constructed from 2x2 LEGO bricks
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	Like with the triangles, the total number of bricks in a pyramid
	of height n (the "nth square pyrimidal number") could be
	calculated using a sum. Each layer has \(i^2\) bricks, so the total
	number of bricks is:
	$$ \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 $$
	This sum also has a closed-form solution:
	$$ \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $$
	Again, this could be "verified" by manually counting the number of bricks
	in different sized pyramids, or proven more rigorously by induction.
</p>

<h4>Exercise: Saving Bricks</h4>
<p>
	As pyramids get tall, the total number of bricks required grows quickly.
	To build a pyramid of height 10, we would need
	\( \frac{(10)(11)(21)}{6} = 385 \) bricks! We can significantly reduce
	the total number of bricks required by making the pyramid "hollow" - 
	that is, by removing any bricks that aren't visible from the top:
	<figure>
		<img class="embed_image" src="hollow_pyramid.png">
		<figcaption>A "hollow" pyramid of height 6, seen from below</figcaption>
	</figure>
</p>

<p>
	As a challenge, try to answer the following questions:
	<ol>
		<li>How many bricks are in layer \(i\) of a hollow pyramid?</li>
		<li>How can we express the total number of bricks in a pyramid
		of height \(n\) as a sum?</li>
		<li>What is the closed-form solution to that sum?</li>
		<li>For a pyramid of height \(n\), how many bricks do we save
		by constructing a hollow pyramid rather than a solid one?</li>
	</ol>

	Sample answers to those questions are available on 
	<a href="hollow_answers.html">a separate page</a>.

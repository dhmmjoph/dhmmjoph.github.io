Below are answers to the hollow pyramid challenge problems given on the
<a href="index.html">Triangle &amp; Pyramid Math</a> page.

<h3>How many bricks are in layer \(i\) of a hollow pyramid?</h3>
<p>
	Each layer is a hollow square of length \( i \times i \). So, a reasonable
	guess for the number of bricks in an \( i \times i \) hollow square is
	\( 4i \). However, the 4 bricks in the corners of the square are each
	part of 2 sides, and so are double-counted by the above guess. Thus, 
	the total number of bricks in layer \( i \) is:
	$$ 4i - 4 $$
</p>
<p>
	Notice that this expression predicts that the first layer of a hollow
	pyramid has \( (4)(1) - 4 = 0 \) bricks, which is obviously false.
	However, the expression gives the correct result for all other values
	of \( n \). Thus, technically the number of bricks in layer i of a
	hollow pyramid is the piecewise function:
	$$
		b(i) = 
		\left\{
		\begin{array}{ll}
			1 & i = 1\\
			4i - 4 & i > 1\\
		\end{array}
		\right.
	$$
</p>

<h3>How can we express the total number of bricks in a pyramid of height \(n\) as a sum?</h3>
<p>
	Since layer 1 has 1 brick, and each subsequent layer \(i\) has \(4i-4\)
	bricks, the total number of bricks could be calculated as:
	$$ 1 + \sum_{i=2}^n (4i-4) $$

	Since \( 4i-4 = 0 \) for \(i=1\), this is equal to:
	$$ 1 + \sum_{i=1}^n (4i-4) $$
	which will make things easier when calculating the closed-form solution below.
</p>

<h3>What is the closed-form solution to that sum?</h3>
<p>
	By using the properties of summation notation, we can break the sum into
	simpler sums:
	$$ 1 + \sum_{i=1}^n (4i-4)  =  1 + 4\sum_{i=1}^n i - \sum_{i=1}^n 4 $$
	As we saw earlier, \( \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Further,
	\( \sum_{i=1}^n 4 = 4n \). Then our expression becomes:
	$$ 1 + 4 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right) - 4n $$
	From there, some relatively simple algebra can be used to simplify
	the expression:
	$$
		\begin{eqnarray}
			&   & 1 + 4 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right) - 4n \\
			& = & 2n(n+1) - 4n + 1\\
			& = & 2n^2 + 2n - 4n + 1\\
			& = & 2n^2 - 2n + 1\\
		\end{eqnarray}
	$$

	So, a hollow pyramid of height \( n \) requires \( 2n^2 - 2n + 1 \) bricks.
</p>

<h3>For a pyramid of height \(n\), how many bricks do we save by constructing a hollow pyramid rather than a solid one?</h3>
<p>
	The number of bricks saved is equal to the number of bricks in the
	solid pyramid minus the number of bricks in the hollow pyramid:

	$$  
		\begin{eqnarray}
			&   & \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - (2n^2 - 2n + 1)\\
			& = & \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6} - 2n^2 + 2n - 1\\
			& = & \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6} - \frac{12n^2}{6} + \frac{12n}{6} - \frac{6}{6}\\
			& = & \frac{2n^3 - 9n^2 + 13n - 6}{6}\\
		\end{eqnarray}
	$$
</p>
<p>
	Alternately, notice that making a solid pyramid of height \(n\) hollow
	involves removing from it a solid pyramid of height \( n-2 \).
	Then the number of bricks saved is:
	$$
		\begin{eqnarray}
			\sum_{i=1}^{n-2} i^2
			& = & \frac{(n-2)([n-2]+1)(2[n-2]+1)}{6}\\
			& = & \frac{(n-2)(n-1)(2n-3)}{6}\\
			& = & \frac{2n^3 - 9n^2 + 13n - 6}{6}\\
		\end{eqnarray}
	$$
	which is the same thing we obtained using the other method.

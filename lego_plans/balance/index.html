<h3>Constructing the Scale</h3>
<p>
	Using relatively few parts, it is easy to construct a simple balance scale.
	This particular scale (.ldr file <a href="balance.ldr">here</a>)
	can be made from parts included in the 9689 "Simple Machines" set:

	</figure>
</p>
<p>
	In particular, note the technique used to attach the vertical beams
	to the base. By sandwiching two plates in between two Technic bricks,
	the resulting vertical spacing is equivalent to three Technic units:

</p>

<h3>Finding Factors</h3>
<p>
	By placing different numbers of 2x1 bricks at different distances from the
	pivot point, we can cause the scale to still be balanced. For example,
	if we place a single brick 10 studs from the center, and two bricks
	5 studs from the center, the balance of the scale will be maintained.
</p>
<p>
	In general, \(n_1\) bricks \(d_1\) studs from the center will be balanced
	by \(n_2\) bricks \(d_2\) studs from the center if, and only if,
	\( n_1 \times d_1 = n_2 \times d_2\). In other words, the scale will be
	balanced if the pairs \( (n_1,d_1) \) and \( (n_2,d_2) \) are sets of factors
	of the same number.
</p>
<p>
	Not all brick arrangements on one side of the scale can be balanced
	by different arrangements on the other side. For example, a single brick
	3 studs from the center could not be balanced by any other number of bricks
	at any other distance, since there are no paris of whole numbers other than
	\( (1,3) \) that multiply to 3. (By definition, prime numbers' only factors
	are themselves and 1).
</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>
<p>
	Try to answer these questions either mathematically or by experimenting with
	the scale:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Fill in the empty cells in the following table with the values necessary
		to balance the scale:
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>\(n_1\)</th>
				<th>\(d_1\)</th>
				<th>\(n_2\)</th>
				<th>\(d_2\)</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>2</td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>4</td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>8</td>
				<td></td>
				<td>16</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td></td>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>4</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>9</td>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>6</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</li>
	<li>
		List as many balanced configurations as possible given that
		(a) the balance beam extends 20 studs from the center,
		(b) 8 or fewer bricks are used, and 
		(c) the left side of the scale has fewer bricks than the right side
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<h4>9689 Brick Mass</h4>
<p>
	If doing this activity with the 9689 set as suggested above, note that, 
	while the set includes 8 total 2x2 bricks, they are not all the same type:
	<figure>
		<img class="embed_image" src="brick_types.png">
	</figure>
	Using eight of either type of brick works fine, but mixing the types is
	not advised, since the bricks have different masses.
</p>

<h4>Slight Imprecisions</h4>
<p>
	Note also that the pivot point is not on a stud, but halfway in between
	two studs. This means, for example, that a position of 8 studs from the
	center is not twice as far as a position of 4 studs from the center.
	However, the difference is small enough that balancing the scale is still
	easily possible.

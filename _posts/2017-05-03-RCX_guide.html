<p>
	Despite being the oldest of the three Mindstorms programmable bricks, the RCX remains my favorite.
	I love its simplicity, small size, and its relative reliance on traditional LEGO&reg; studs,
	rather than Technic beams. However, using an RCX is in some ways harder and more complicated than
	when it was first released in 1998. This article will attempt to summarize some of the equipment,
	software, and techniques necessary to use an RCX in 2017.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="why">Why use an RCX?</h2>
<p>
	There are several reasons you might want to use an RCX instead of an NXT or EV3:
	<ol>
		<li>
			<em>You already have one.</em> Maybe you're a teacher, and your school never bought newer
			Mindstorms sets. Maybe you found your old RCX equipment in the attic, and want to play with
			it again. Maybe you're like me, and you never stopped playing with it in the first place.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>They're cheap.</em> If you have a limited budget to spend on Mindstorms parts, or you want
			to buy a kit for a child, but you aren't sure if they'll use it enough to justify the cost
			of a more-expensive NXT or EV3 set, the RCX could be a good choice.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>They're simple.</em> For small, uncomplicated, or permenant projects, the low cost and relative
			simplicity of the RCX make it a good choice.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>You have a thing for retro technology.</em> Admit it: There's something appealing about the 7-segment
			LCD display, the infrared communication, and the 8-bit SOC.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware Guide</h2>
<h3 id="rcx_brick">RCX Brick</h3>
<p>
	The RCX brick comes in 3 hardware revisions:

	<p>
		<b>1.0</b> - The original. The only revision to include a power input jack, so that in addition
		to 6 AA batteries, it can also be powered by a 9-12V <b>AC</b> power supply. (Yes, you read that
		right: It's an AC input).
	</p>		

	<p>
		<b>1.5 (also called 1.1)</b> - Included with the Robotics Invention System (RIS) 1.5 set.
		Identical to the 1.0 brick except that the power input jack has been removed. Officially,
		the 1.5 brick is also called an 1.0 brick, <del>but with a serial number 
		<a href="https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/1105/why-does-my-rcx-programmable-brick-have-no-power-socket">greater than approximately 300000</a>.</del>
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>2.0</b> - Identical to the 1.5 brick except that the IR interface operates at
		<a href="https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/8049/lego-rcx-1-0-brick-relationship-to-robotics-invention-system-ris-rcx-firmwar">
		twice the frequency</a> (76 kHz instead of 38 kHz). This has the effect of slightly reduced range,
		but enables the 2.0 brick to talk to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Spybotics">
		Spybotics products</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Update 11 July 2020:</em> The "serial number greater than 300000" thing seems to not be quite true - and in fact any reference to it seems to have been removed
		from the stackexchange thread linked above. <a href="https://legoeducacional-umcontributo.blogspot.com">Leonardo Verde</a> has been doing some research on
		RCX serial numbers, and is collecting data about the type and serial number of many RCX bricks in <a href="https://legoeducacional-umcontributo.blogspot.com/2020/05/rcx-numeracao.html">
		this form</a>. He's also shared the results with me; here's a snapshot at the time of writing:
		<table class="table table-striped w-auto mx-auto text-center">
			<tr class="border-bottom border-dark">
				<th>Total Responses</th>
				<td>126</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Number of 1.0 bricks</th>
				<td>66</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Highest 1.0 serial number</th>
				<td>990439</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="border-bottom border-dark">
				<th>Lowest 1.0 serial number</th>
				<td>284</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Number of 1.5 bricks</th>
				<td>21</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Highest 1.5 serial number</th>
				<td>585813</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="border-bottom border-dark">
				<th>Lowest 1.5 serial number</th>
				<td>356161</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Number of 2.0 bricks</th>
				<td>39</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Highest 2.0 serial number</th>
				<td>996764</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Lowest 2.0 serial number</th>
				<td>514846</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		So it looks like 1.5 bricks do reliably have a serial number over 300000, but 1.0 bricks can have such serial numbers too.
	</p>

	Aside from those diffrences, all hardware revisions are functionally identical, and all firmware versions
	are compatible with all hardware revisions. I tend to favor the 1.0 brick due to the inclusion of the
	power input, and in any case the 1.0 seems to be the most commonly-available brick online.

</p>
<h3 id="ir_tower">Infrared Tower</h3>
<p>
	The infrared tower is used to send programs from a computer to the RCX, and data from the RCX back to
	the computer for logging. There are two models of infrared tower. One connects via a 
	<a href="http://www.nullmodem.com/DB-9.htm">DE-9 serial port</a> and requires a 9-volt battery, while the
	other connects over USB, and can get enough power from that so as to not require a battery. The USB model
	is more convenient to use (due to the lack of additional battery), and seems to be more readily available
	online.

<h3 id="ir_tower_x64">USB Infrared Tower on 64-bit Windows</h3>
<em><small>Thanks to Reddit user MindS1 for 
	<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mindstorms/comments/6h19wn/thought_yall_might_like_to_read_an_article_i/diwdgkg/">
		correcting a previous error</a> in this section.</small></em>
<!-- <p>
	For many years, the common wisdom was that the USB infrared tower was not supported on 64-bit versions of 
	windows, the reason being that LEGO never wrote a 64-bit driver for the USB tower. Recently, however, a
	64-bit compatible USB tower driver <a href="http://www.legoengineering.com/rcx-usb-tower-support/">
	has become available</a>, courtesy of the people at <a href="http://www.legoengineering.com/">
	LegoEngineering.com</a>, a joint project of Tufts University's Center for Engineering Education and
	Outreach, LEGO Education, and various other educators. Note that this driver is only compatible with
	ROBOLAB software (more info on RCX languages <a href="#program">below</a>); thus, the USB IR tower can
	only be used with ROBOLAB on 64-bit versions of Windows. The serial IR tower can be used on 64-bit versions
	of windows in conjunction with a USB-to-DE-9 adapter.
</p> -->
<p>
	A general-puspose Windows driver for the USB tower is only available for 32-bit Windows.
	For 64-bit Windows, there is <a href="http://www.legoengineering.com/rcx-usb-tower-support/">
	this driver available</a>, but it's only compatible with <a href="http://www.legoengineering.com/robolab-for-labview/">
	"ROBOLAB for LabView"</a>. Note that "ROBOLAB for LabView" requires an existing installation of LabView, and is <em>not</em>
	 the same thing as "ROBOLAB".
</p>
<p>
	If you want to program an RCX brick from 64-bit Windows using any other software (ROBOLAB, ROBOTC, NQC, etc.), you can do so
	with a serial IR tower (and a USB-to-DB-9 adapter cable, if needed).
</p>

<h3 id="motors">Motors</h3>
<p>
	RCX-compatible motors come in 2 shapes, which I'll call "rectangular" and "cubic". 
	The cubic motors appear in more sets, and are in my opinion easier to work with.
	<figure class="figure w-100">
		<img class="figure-img img-fluid w-80 mx-auto" src="/img/rcx_guide/motors.png">
		<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Left: rectangular motor
			(<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2838c01">2838c01</a>). 
			Right: cubic motor (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=71427c01">71427c01
			</a>/<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=43362c01">43362c01</a>).
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	Cubic motors come in 2 hardware revisions. However, unlike the RCX brick, there are no visual
	cues on the outside of the motors to tell the hardware revisions apart. The primary difference between the 2
	revisions is that the older motors use internal gears made of metal, whereas in the newer motors the internal
	gears are made of plastic. As a result, the older hardware revision is more durable. It's also heavier, which is
	the best way to tell the difference between the two hardware revisions. You'll see the older revision described
	on Bricklink as "Older, heavier weight" and the newer revision described as "Newer, lighter weight".
</p>
<h3 id="sensors">Sensors</h3>
<p>
	The first-party sensors available for the RCX are Light, Rotation, Touch, and Temperature. In addition, a number
	of third-party sensors are available, and LEGO&reg; also produced a "DCP Sensor Adapter" which converted the
	RCX connector to a 7-Pin DIN socket compatible with  LogIT Microsense scientific sensors made by
	<a href="http://ccgi.dcpmicro.plus.com/DCPMICRO/lego.htm">DCP Microdevelopments</a>.

		<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Clockwise from bottom left: Light sensor, rotation sensor, temperature sensor,
		touch sensor</figcaption>
	</figure>
</p>
<h3 id="wires">Wires</h3>
<p>
	The wires used for connecting motors and sensors to the RCX brick are terminated at either end with a 2x2x2/3 
	brick with electrical contacts on the top and bottom. Wires are available in lengths of 15, 17, 20, 21, 26, 36,
	46, 69, 162, and 378 studs <a href="http://studs.sariel.pl/">(1 stud = 8 mm = 0.315 in)</a>. Every first-party
	sensor except for the touch sensor comes with a short wire permenantly affixed to the sensor.

<p>
	There also exists <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=9738-1">an infrared remote

	time without the need for programming.

<h2 id="buy">Buying an RCX</h2>
<p>
	If you don't already have an RCX, you'll need to buy a brick and an infrared tower. You'll probably also want 
	to buy some combination of motors and sensors, depending on your application.
</p>
<h3 id="buy_set">Buying a set</h3>
<p>
	If you're new to Mindstorms, you'll probably want to buy a set containing a bunch of parts. 
	<a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> and <a href="https://www.bricklink.com">Bricklink</a>
	are both good places to buy RCX sets online.

		*Sets 9785/9786 and 9793/9794 are identical to each other except for the type of the IR tower. <br/>
		&dagger;LEGO changed the production method of the cubic motors with little fanfare, and in the middle
		of production of various sets. Thus, it's hard to tell whether a set you buy will contain the older or
		newer cubic motors, especially when purchasing a newer set (lookin' at you, 3804).

	</figure>
	The ideal set would be one that contains an RCX 1.0 brick, older cubic motors, and a USB IR tower. As you
	can see, such a set doesn't exist. So, you'll have to decide which of those features you care about most and
	which you could do without. Alternatively, you could purchase either set 9790 or 9719 and supplement
	that with a USB IR tower, which can be indiviually purchased for relatively little online.

	is the best place to buy individual Mindstorms components (or individual LEGO&reg; components of any kind).

<h2 id="program">Programming an RCX</h2>
<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>
	In my experience, programming an RCX brick is most easily done from a computer running Windows. Several
	languages are available. On 64-bit versions of Windows, the USB IR tower can only be used by ROBOLAB;
	<a href="#ir_tower_x64">see above</a> for more info.
</p>
<p>
	<b>ROBOLAB</b> is the best of a couple of pieces of software officially distributed by LEGO for programming
	RCX bricks. It's based on National Instruments LabView, and unlike later LabView-based Mindstorms software (NXT-G and EV3-G),
	the visual resemblence is striking. The latest version of ROBOLAB is 2.9.4c, though version 2.5.4 is similar;
	the primary difference is that 2.9.4c can also program NXT bricks. Unfortunately, it can be pretty difficult to
	get ahold of a copy of ROBOLAB these days if you don't already have one; relatively few copies are available on
	Bricklink, and can go for upwards of $50. Note that after installing v2.9.4 from a CD, you'll want to also
	install the 2.9.4c patch, which can be found <a href="http://www.legoengineering.com/robolab-2-9-4c-patch/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	These days, I do most of my RCX programming in <b>ROBOTC</b>.
	As the name implies, ROBOTC is a C-based language designed for robotics; versions of ROBOTC are also available
	for NXT/EV3 programmable bricks, VEX IQ "robot brain", VEX Cortex/Pic microcontrollers, and Arduino. Support for
	the RCX is not included with current versions of ROBOTC; however, a 
	<a href="http://robotc.net/download/rcx/">legacy RCX version</a> is available, and this has the added advantage
	of being free, whereas other versions of ROBOTC are not. ROBOTC also comes packaged with a pretty good
	Integrated Development Environment, and lots of help and resources are available to learn how to use
	it, because of the support for many popular educational robotics platforms.
</p>
<p>
	Another C-based language for the RCX is <a href="http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nqc/"><b>NQC</b></a> 
	("Not Quite C"). One of the oldest third-party languages for the RCX, NQC has the advantage of working
	on all three popular desktop operating systems, and developer Dave Baum has written
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dave-Baum/e/B00DPYSTWE/">several books</a> about the RCX system,
	which include information about NQC and its use. Another advantage of NQC is that it uses the
	stock firmware on the RCX (i.e., the same as used by ROBOLAB), unlike ROBOTC or LeJOS.
</p>
<p>
	For people who prefer programming in Java, there's <b><a href="http://www.lejos.org/rcx.php">LeJOS</a></b>.
	Short for "LEGO Java Operating System", versions of LeJOS are also available for the newer NXT and EV3
	bricks, and LeJOS has proven to be one of the most popualr languages for third-party RCX programming.
</p>
<p>
	Several other languages exist for the RCX, with which I am less familiar or which are hard to find
	nowadays. These include:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.brickwiki.info/wiki/PbFORTH"><b>pbForth</b></a> - an implementation of
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> for the RCX.
			Deveoped by <a href="https://github.com/rhempel">Ralph Hempel</a>, who later worked on
			<a href="https://github.com/7HAL32/pbLua">pbLua</a> for the NXT and
			<a href="http://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> for the EV3.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://brickos.sourceforge.net/"><b>brickOS</b></a> - allows you to program
			your RCX in C or C++. Never used it before. Latest release dates back to 2004, and I'm
			not sure if anybody still actively uses it.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<b><a href="http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/">Bricxcc</a></b> is a popular Mindstorms IDE for Windows 
	which supports programming the RCX using NQC, LeJOS, brickOS, and other languages.
</p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
<p>
	As far as I'm aware, there are no GUI Linux applications for controlling the RCX. However, if you're
	comfortable with the command line (and if you're a linux user, you probably are), there are
	several choices. These include:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b><a href="http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nqc/">NQC</a></b> - the most popular choice on Linux.
			A cross-platform C-like language for the RCX. Also includes various command-line tools, including
			the ability to send arbitraty files and opcodes to the RCX, which can be useful for programming
			in some other languages and for general hacking purposes.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b><a href="http://www.lejos.org/rcx.php">LeJOS</a></b> - Java virtual machine for the RCX.
			Versions also available for the NXT and EV3.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b><a href="http://www.brickwiki.info/wiki/PbFORTH"><b>pbForth</b></a></b> - an implementation
			of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> for the RCX.
			Deveoped by <a href="https://github.com/rhempel">Ralph Hempel</a>, who later worked on
			<a href="https://github.com/7HAL32/pbLua">pbLua</a> for the NXT and
			<a href="http://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> for the EV3.
			An advantage of pbForth is that it compiles programs on the RCX brick itself rather than on
			the computer you're using, so all that's really required is the ability to transfer plaintext
			files from to and from the RCX, which can easily be accomplished on Linux with NQC.

<p>
	It's worth noting that drivers for the USB IR tower are included with essentially all versions of the Linux
	kernel released in the last 10 years or so.

<h3 id="mac">Mac</h3>
<p>
	If you have a modern Mac, the easiest thing to do is to program your RCX in a Windows virtual
	machine (using a piece of software like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>,
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_Fusion">VMWare Fusion</a>, or
	<a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>). I've run various versions of ROBOLAB and ROBOTC
	in a virtual machine on various Macs, with no apparent loss of functionality.
</p>
<p>
	Mac software for programming RCX bricks does exist, but is generally either classic Mac OS software or OS X 
	software compiled for PowerPC, meaning that it won't run on modern Macs. However, if you have an older Mac
	running Mac OS 9 or an older version of OS X (10.5 or older for running PowerPC software, 
	10.4 or older for running classic Mac OS software), it is often still possible to program an RCX natively
	on a Mac.
</p>
<p>
	LEGO released versions of <b>ROBOLAB</b> for the Mac, and versions 2.5.4 and 2.9.4 are available as native OS X
	software compiled for PowerPC. As far as I'm aware, the functionality of Mac versions of ROBOLAB is identical
	to the corresponding version on Windows, though I've never used v2.9.4 for mac. ROBOLAB for Mac is
	even harder to find online than ROBOLAB for Windows, although it appears that later versions of the
	software were distributed on a single disc containing both Windows and Mac versions of the software.
</p>
<p>
	<b><a href="http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nqc/">NQC</a></b>,
	<b><a href="http://www.lejos.org/rcx.php">LeJOS</a></b>, and
	<b><a href="http://brickos.sourceforge.net/">brickOS</a></b> all have varying degrees of compatibility
	with OS X. Sometimes, compiled versions of the software are available for the Mac; other times, it's necessary
	to compile the software yourself. I'm not aware of any Mac IDEs for any of those languages; the NQC website
	links to a Mac NQC IDE called <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rbate/MacNQC/">MacNQC</a> but the link is
	dead at the time of writing.
</p>
<p>
	Since <b>pbForth</b> compiles and runs code on the RCX itself, all that's
	necessary to use it on a mac is the ability to send plaintext files from the mac to the RCX, which can be
	accomplished with NQC.

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<small><em>Mostly compiled from searches of <a href="https://www.quora.com/search?q=lego+rcx">Quora</a>,
	the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mindstorms/search?q=rcx&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all">
	Mindstorms subreddit</a>, and the
	<a href="https://bricks.stackexchange.com/search?q=rcx">LEGO Stack Exchange</a>.</em></small>
<h3 id="batteries">I changed the batteries in my RCX and now all my programs are missing! What happened?</h3>
<p>
	The RCX's programs and firmware are stored in RAM. This made the brick cheaper to manufacture, because
	RAM was much cheaper than flash storage in the 1990s. However, a downside of RAM is that it needs to be
	continuously powered to retain the data it's storing. Thus, when power is cut to the RCX, such as when
	batteries are removed, its memory is erased, and it reverts to the default firmware and programs.
</p>
<p>
	Happily, inside the RCX there is a small capacitor, which maintains power to the RAM for approximately
	20 seconds after the batteries are removed. Thus, if you change the batteries within that time, the
	brick's memory will be preserved. Changing the RCX's batteries within 20 seconds sounds difficult,
	but is actually not too hard with some practice.
</p>

<h3 id="64bit_q">I read on [Website] that I can't use the USB IR tower with 64-bit Windows! Is that true?</h3>
<p>
	For most applications, yes. <a href="#ir_tower_x64">See above</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3 id="tv_remote">Can I send data to the RCX from a
	[TV remote/IR port on an old laptop/IR LED and an Arduino]?</h3>
<p>
	The short answer is <b>no</b>. The IR towers and remote for the RCX use a proprietary communications
	protocol, which no one has reverse-engineered and which is incompatible with the protocols used by
	television remotes or IR transmitters on older laptops. 
</p>

<h3 id="sell">I no longer want my RCX bricks/motors/sensors! What should I do with them?</h3>
<p>
	Probably the best thing to do is to sell them on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> or
	<a href="https://www.bricklink.com">Bricklink</a>. If for some reason you don't want to do that,
	<a href="mailto:lego@johnholbrook.us">send me an email</a> -- maybe I'll take it off your hands.
</p>

<h3 id="music">I want my RCX to play music!</h3>
<p>
	This is a surprisingly common thing to want to do. The easiest way I know of is to find or compose
	a piece of music in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Tone_Transfer_Language">
	Ring Tone Text Transfer Language</a>, and then use ROBOTC for RCX, which includes a tool
	(only visible if using menu-level "superuser") for transferring RTTTL tunes to ROBOTC commands which
	cause the RCX to play the described tune.
</p>

<h3 id="nxt_sensor">Can I use RCX motors or sensors with the NXT or EV3? What about with an Arduino or Raspberry Pi?</h3>
<p>
	A <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=x1676">converter cable</a> is available
	which converts the connector used by RCX motors and sensors to the RJ12 connector used by the NXT and EV3.
	The NXT was designed to be backwards-compatible with RCX motors and sensors, and it's easy to do this
	in ROBOLAB 2.9 or NXT-G (with the download of some additional sensor blocks for NXT-G).
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, due to the EV3 using a slightly different pinout for the sensor ports, the LEGO converter cable
	will not connect RCX sensors to the EV3 (more info in 
	<a href="https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/8112/use-legacy-rcx-sensors-with-ev3">this 
	stackexchange thread</a>). Others have produced homemade converter cables which connect the sensors to the
	correct pins on the EV3, but in any case RCX sensors are unsupported in the official EV3 software, so use
	of such converters would have to be in conjunction with a third-party firmware such as LeJOS or
	<a href="http://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="ir_comms">I'm having troube downloading firmware or otherwise transferring large programs or files to the RCX!</h3>
<p>
	In my experience, the most common cause of communications failures is interference from bright room or
	outside light. When downloading firmware or large files to the RCX, I find it helpful to place a box or
	other opaque structure over the RCX and IR tower in order to prevent visible light interference.
</p>
<p>
	Further discussion of other causes of communications failure can be found in
	<a href="https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/1099/rcx-firmware-download-problem">this
		stackexchange thread</a>.

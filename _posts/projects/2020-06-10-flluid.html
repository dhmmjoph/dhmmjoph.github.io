<p>
    I help run a lot of robotics events, mostly <a href="https://www.firstlegoleague.org">FLL</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/">VRC</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexiq/competition/vex-iq-challenge-overview">VIQC</a>, and as a result I end up thinking a lot about
    the tenichical and logistical aspects of running these events. One of the things I like about VRC and VIQC is that the scoring and timing software,
    <a href="https://vextm.dwabtech.com">VEX Tournament Manager</a>, provides a bunch of cool audience-facing displays that effectively convey
    scoring and scheduling information while looking slick and professional.
</p>

<p>
    FLL events don't really have an equivalent to VEX Tournament Manager. There are various pieces of software designed to automate some parts of
    the scoring and display process, but they don't all do everything, and none are the officially-endorsed first-party solution that VEX TM is.
</p>

<p>
    For our FLL events in West Virginia, we use <a href="https://flltournament.com">FLLTournament.com</a>. It's great for inputting match scores,
    automatically ranking teams, digitizing judging rubrics, and recruiting and managing volunteers. But, it's single audience-facing display is...
    not very pretty, and it doesn't have a built-in match timer, a schedule display, or many of the other audience-facing dsiplays I like in VEX TM.
</p>

<p>
    What I really wanted was some software that pulled match score information from FLLTournament.com and displayed it in a more full-featured
    "audience display" like that provided by VEX TM. This software didn't seem to exist, so I wrote it.

    <b>FLLuid</b> (<b>FLL U</b>seful <b>I</b>nformation <b>D</b>isplay) is an easy-to-use, customizable audience display package for FLL events run using FLLTournament.com. Features include:
    <ul>
        <li>Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux</li>
        <li>Match timer suitable for use with or without streaming video</li>
        <li>Match scores display</li>

        <li>Show top scores from other qualifying events</li>
        <li>Show sponsor logos on their own display, or in between match scores or schedule</li>
        <li>Keep the audience up-to-date with custom messages</li>
        <li>Customize the appearance and behavior of displays in various ways</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    FLLuid presents two windows: the "display window", which is shown full-screen to the audience; and the "controller window", which
    contains the interface for controlling what's shown in the display window.

    I started working on FLLuid in November 2019, and have been working on it on and off since then. As of July 2020, I've implemented most
    the features I want in an initial release, and I hope to have v1.0 out in time for the 2020-2021 FLL season in WV, whenever that happens.

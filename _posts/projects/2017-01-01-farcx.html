<p>
    <b>FaRCX</b> is software for controlling LEGO&reg; RCX robots over the internet, with live-streaming video. It's a joint project
    between myself and <a href="https://www.philipt.net">Philip Taylor</a>.

<p>
    FaRCX is the spiritual successor to <a href="http://www.brickvista.com/features/redRover/redRover.html">Red Rover, Red Rover</a>,
    a previous project to establish a world-wide network of remotely-operable RCX robots. FaRCX is better than the RRRR software because
    it runs on modern operating systems, works with live-streaming video (RRRR just sent a new still image every time you did something),
    and is powered by such newfangled web technologies as PHP and Javascript.

    I wrote more about the origins and motivations behind FaRCX in <a href="{{site.url}}/FaRCX_history.html">this post</a>.

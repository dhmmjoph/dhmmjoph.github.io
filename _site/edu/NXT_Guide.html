			<h1>The NXT&#58; Mindstorms Gets Smarter</h1>
			<em>A hardware and programming guide to the second-generation Mindstorms platform</em>
			<!-- Content goes here -->
			<p>
	8 years after its release, the RCX was beginning to show its age. Microprocessor technology
	had advanced beyond the necessity of some of its biggest limitations, including its 
	seven-segment display, infrared communications, relatively weak and fragile motors,
	and limited onboard storage and processor instruction set.
</p>
<p>
	In 2006, LEGO released the second-generation Mindstorms platform, the NXT. It represented a
	significant departure from the previous generation, bringing with it new motors, new sensors,
	a strikingly different visual programming language, and a graphical on-brick interface with more
	features. If the RCX reflects the state of mobile computing in 1998, the NXT brings the
	Mindstorms line into the 21st century.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Improvements over the RCX</h2>
	<p>
		The NXT features several improvements in functionality over the previous-generation RCX platform.
		These include, but are not limited to:
		<ul>
			<li><b>A larger, bitmapped screen</b>, which allows for a more advanced user interface,
				including limited on-brick programming environment.</li>
			<li><b>USB Connectivity</b>, so you don't have to screw around with infrared communications.</li>
			<li><b>Bluetooth Connectivity</b>, for wireless downloading of programs from a computer and
				(with third-party apps) real-time control of a robot from a smartphone.</li>
			<li><b>More powerful motors with built-in encoders</b>, so your robot can pull more and keep
				track of how far it's gone without the need for external rotation sensors.</li>
			<li><b>A 4th sensor input port</b>, for connecting an additional sensor.</li>
			<li><b>The ability to store more than 5 programs at once</b>, though due to the relatively
				small amount of on-board storage it's still possible to run out of space, especially by
				storing sound clips.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Hardware Guide</h2>
	<h3>NXT Brick</h3>
	<p>
		There is only one hardware revision of NXT brick. The front of the brick features a 
		100x60-pixel monochrome screen, and four buttons (left, right, OK, and back) for navigating
		the user interface. The top features three motor ports and the USB-B port for downloading
		programs from a computer, while the bottomfeatures four sensor ports. The battery door
		is located on the back, along with mounting holes for Technic pins, which can also
		be found on the left and right sides of the brick.
		<figure>
			<img class="embed_image" src="http://localhost:4000/img/nxt_guide/nxt_all_sides.png">
			<figcaption>NXT Brick, seen from all sides</figcaption>
		</figure>
		In addition to the standard white color, LEGO released a black NXT brick in early
		2009, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Mindstorms product line. Only 1,998 units
		were made (corresponding with the launch year of the Mindstorms line), with each brick originally
		selling for US$169. These are quite rare compared to the white NXT brick, and have become collectors
		items, with sealed-in-box units selling for quite a bit more than the original price on Bricklink.
		<figure>

		</figure>
	</p>

	<h3>Rechargable Battery Pack</h3>
	<p>
		A rechargable battery pack was available from LEGO&reg; Education (and included in the
		educational NXT kits) which replaced the 6 AA batteries on which the NXT otherwise runs.
		In addition to recharging the battery, the power input jack can also be used to continuously
		power the NXT brick. This is an extremely convenient part to have, as it alleviates the need to
		take a robot apart regularly to swap batteries.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two hardware revisions of the battery pack were released. The first revision (dark grey in color)
		works with the same 9-12V <b>AC</b> power supply compatible with the RCX 1.0 brick (Yes, you read that
		right, it's an AC input). The second revision (white in color) works with a 10V <b>DC</b> power supply,
		was also later included with the EV3 rechargable battery pack.
		<figure>
			<img class="embed_image" src="http://localhost:4000/img/nxt_guide/battery_pack.png">
			<figcaption>Rechargable battery pack, with charging port visible</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing to note is that the battery pack sticks out from the bottom of the NXT brick further than the
		AA battery door, adding 1 stud to the total height of the brick.
		<figure>
			<img class="embed_image" src="http://localhost:4000/img/nxt_guide/pack_extra_height.png">
			<figcaption>NXT, with and without battery pack installed. Note that the battery pack makes the NXT brick 1
				stud taller.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</p>

	<h3>Motors</h3>
	<p>
		LEGO&reg; referred to the NXT's motors as "Integrated Servo Motors". This isn't entirely accurate
		(the motor itself is a brushless DC motor, not a servo), but the teminology indicates that the
		motors contain integrated rotation sensors, and keep track of their current position (in degrees)
		since last reset. This eliminated the need for separate rotation sensors (as on the RCX), freeing up
		more sensor ports for use elsewhere.
		<figure>
			<img class="embed_image" src="http://localhost:4000/img/nxt_guide/motor.png">
			<figcaption>NXT Motor</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</p>

	<h3>Sensors</h3>
	<p>
		LEGO&reg; released various first-party sensors for the NXT:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Light Sensor</b> - measures light intensity using a photocell. Can operate in
				"ambient mode" (measuring the ambient light level) or "reflected mode" (using a built-in
				LED to shine on a surface, and measure how much light is reflected back).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Color Sensor</b> - Detects the color of the thing it's pointed at. Can also operate
				in "light sensor" mode, with all the functionality of the normal light sensor.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Touch Sensor</b> - Contains a button; detects when the button is pressed.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Sound Sensor</b> - Detects the ambient sound level (in dB). Disappointingly,
				cannot be used as a microphone to record audio.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor</b> - Sends out ultrasonic pulses from one "eye" and
				times how long they take to come back to the other "eye", translating this into
				distance information about the object the pulses bounced off of.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Temperature Sensor</b> - Contains a probe which, when submerged in a fluid
				(most commonly air or water), detects the temperature of the fluid.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<figure>
			<img class="embed_image" src="http://localhost:4000/img/nxt_guide/first_party_sensors.png">
			<figcaption>First-party NXT Sensors. Left to Right: Light, Color, Touch, Sound,
				Ultrasonic Distance, Temperature.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</p>
	<h3>Third-party accessories</h3>
	<p>
		There are many sensors and other accessories made by various companies available for the NXT;
		an incomplete list of such manufactures is available in
		<a href="https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/969/what-are-all-the-third-party-unofficial-accessories-i-can-get-for-an-nxt">
		this StackExchange thread</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Cables</h3>
	<p>
		Unlike earlier LEGO&reg; motors and sensors, more than two pins are necessary to
		communicate with the NXT's more advanced motors and sensors. Thus, a new style of
		cable and connector was required. The wire connector used for NXT motors and sensors
		is reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack#RJ12">RJ12</a>
		connector, though the retention tab located in the middle of the connector has been moved
		to one side, ensuring incompatibility with standard RJ12 connectors. NXT-style cables are
		available in 20, 25, 35, and 50 centimeter lengths.
		<figure>
			<img class="embed_image" src="http://localhost:4000/img/nxt_guide/cable.png">
			<figcaption>Example of an NXT-style cable, showing RJ12-style connector</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</p>

	<h3>Convertor Cable</h3>
	<p>
		A convertor cable was also available, which allowed RCX motors and sensors to be controlled
		by the NXT.
		<figure>
			<img class="embed_image" src="http://localhost:4000/img/nxt_guide/convertor.jpg">

<h2>Buying Guide</h2>
	<h3>Buying a set</h3>
	<p>
		If you're new to Mindstorms, you'll probably want to buy a set containing a bunch of parts. 
		<a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> and <a href="https://www.bricklink.com">Bricklink</a>
		are both good places to buy NXT sets online.
	</p>
	<p>
		Only three sets were ever released containing NXT bricks:
		<figure>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Set #</th>
					<th>Set Name</th>
					<th>Motors Included</th>
					<th>Sensors Included</th>
					<th>Battery Pack Included?</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>8527</td>
					<td>"Toy" 1.0 Set</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>1 light, 1 sound, 1 touch, 1 ultrasonic</td>
					<td>No</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>8547</td>
					<td>"Toy" 2.0 Set</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>1 color, 2 touch, 1 ultrasonic</td>
					<td>No</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>9797</td>
					<td>Education NXT Set</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>1 light, 1 sound, 2 touch, 1 ultrasonic</td>
					<td>Yes</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</figure>
	</p>
	<p>
		An interesting question is, which set contains the best combination of included electronic components?
		My personal preference is for set 9797 due to the included rechargable battery. However, the color
		sensor included with set 8547 can be a nice thing to have for some applications. I think
		the 8527 set can be largely eleminated as a candidate for "best set" because the sensor selection is unremarkable
		and no rechargable battery pack is included. However, it could be worth picking up if the price is right.
	</p>

	<h3>Buying individual parts</h3>
	<p>
		If you already have a bunch of LEGO&reg; elements, you can save some money by buying only the
		electronic components you want. In my experience, <a href="https://www.bricklink.com">Bricklink</a>
		is the best place to buy individual Mindstorms components (or individual LEGO&reg; components of any kind).
		Here are links to all the parts I've mentioned:

<h2>Programming</h2>
	<h3>First Party</h3>
		<p>
			Programming the NXT is possible in several first-party programs. All are based on National Instruments
			LabView, though some bear more visual resemblance to vanilla LabView than others. All are compatible with
			Windows and macOS.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>NXT-G</b> is the programming environment originally released with the NXT brick. This is the most
			popular first-party software for programming NXT bricks, though in my experience it's also the
			most prone to graphical and other glitches. NXT-G was made available in "Home" and "Education" versions; the 
			primary difference is that the Education version includes data-logging functionality; however, only
			the "Home" version is <a href="https://wwwsecure.us.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads/nxt-software-download">
			available for free download</a> from the LEGO website. NXT-G is also the only first-party
			software with support for downloading programs over Bluetooth, rather than USB.
			<figure>
				<img class="embed_image" src="http://localhost:4000/img/nxt_guide/nxtg_program.png">
				<figcaption>Screenshot of NXT-G Interface, showing basic program</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>
		<p>
			Though it was originally designed for programming the RCX brick and DACTA Control Panel (70909),
			<b>version 2.9 of ROBOLAB</b> also includes support for the NXT. ROBOLAB is much more visually similar to
			vanilla LabView than NXT-G, which can be initially off-putting but can also afford more flexibility in programming
			and fewer graphical glitches. Most features of ROBOLAB are supported, including data-logging, and new bricks are
			added for controlling the NXT's new motors and sensors. Unfortunately, downloading programs via Bluetooth is not supported.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last updated in 2006 and originally written well before then, continnuing functionality of ROBOLAB on
			modern operating systems is not guaranteed. ROBOLAB will install and run fine on all modern versions of
			Windows, including Windows 10; however, because Mac versions of ROBOLAB 2.9 were only ever distributed as
			PowerPC binaries, and thus won't run on macOS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or newer<a id="robolab_source" href="#robolab_footnote">*</a>.
			Thus, running ROBOLAB on a modern Mac is best done inside a Windows virtual machine, which works fine in my experience.
			Unfortunately, it can be pretty difficult to get ahold of a copy of ROBOLAB these days if you don't already have one; 
			relatively few copies are available on Bricklink, and can go for upwards of $50. Note that after installing v2.9.4 from
			a CD, you'll want to also install the 2.9.4c patch, which can be found <a href="http://www.legoengineering.com/robolab-2-9-4c-patch/">here</a>.

				<figcaption>Screenshot of ROBOLAB 2.9 interface, showing a basic program for the NXT</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>
		<p>
			Released with the third-generation EV3 platform, <b>EV3-G</b> is backwards-compatible with the NXT brick as well.
			EV3-G is visually and functionally similar to NXT-G, though slightly more stable. Like NXT-G, EV3-G is available
			in "Home" and "Education" editions, with the Education edition supporting data-logging but only the Home edition
			available for free download. Most of EV3-G's functionality is usable with the NXT, though Bluetooth downloading is not.

	<h3>Third Party</h3>
	<small><em>
		This section contains information on the most popular and interesting third-party languages for the NXT.
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT#Programming">Wikipedia</a> contains a much more complete
		list of NXT languages.
	</small></em>

	<p>Many Third-party languages are available for the NXT. Here is a selection of the most popular and interesting:</p>
	<p>
		<b><a href="http://robotc.net/download/lego/">ROBOTC</a></b> is an excellent C-based programming language for robotics, 
		with an accompanying IDE. Versions of ROBOTC are also available for the RCX, EV3, VEX PIC, VEX Cortex, VEX IQ, and 
		Arduino platforms. The IDE that comes bundled with ROBOTC is pretty good, and there are plentyof educational resources
		online for use with ROBOTC, owing to its cross-platform availability. However, a disadvantage of ROBOTC is that it isn't free.

		<br/>
		<b>Platforms</b>: Windows only (but works well in a VM on other platforms).
	</p>
	<p>
		Another C-based language for the NXT is <b><a href="http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/">NXC</a></b> ("Not eXactly C"). NXC
		is basically the successor to the NQC project for the RCX, and is built on top of Next Byte Codes (NBC), an assembly-type
		language for the NXT. Much documentation and help is available for NXC, including a whopping 
		<a href="http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/nxcdoc/NXC_Guide.pdf">2447-page PDF guide</a> of which 63 pages comprise the
		table of contents!

		<br/>
		<b>Platforms</b>: Windows, Mac, Linux
	</p>
	<p>
		For those who prefer Java, there's <b><a href="http://www.lejos.org/nxj.php">LeJOS</a></b> ("LEGO Java Operating System"),
		which is a Java virtual machine for the RCX, NXT, and EV3. LeJOS has proven to be one of the most popular languages for
		third-party Mindstorms programming, perhaps because of its compatibility with all programmable bricks and/or the inexplicable
		popularity of Java.

		<br/>
		<b>Platforms</b>: Windows, Mac, Linux
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><a href="https://github.com/7HAL32/pbLua">pbLua</a></b> is a version of the popular 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)">Lua</a> programming language for the NXT. It was developed
		by <a href="https://github.com/rhempel">Ralph Hempel</a>, who previously wrote pbFORTH for the RCX and later worked on
		ev3dev for the EV3. An advantage of pbLua is that programs are compiled on-brick, rather than on a computer before transfer.
		Thus, once you've installed the pbLua firmware on the NXT, all that's needed is the ability to transfer plaintext files to the
		NXT via USB or Bluetooth.

		<br/>
		<b>Platforms</b>: Windows, Mac, Linux
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><a href="https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python">NXT-Python</a></b> is a Python package for controlling an NXT.
		Python code runs on a computer, which must be constantly connected to the NXT via USB or Bluetooth. As such,
		an NXT cannot operate in "stand-alone" mode using NXT-Python as it could with most other thrid-party languages.
		However, an advantage of this strategy is that no third-party firmware is required to be running on the NXT.

		<br/>
		<b>Platforms</b>: Windows, Mac, Linux
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><a href="http://enchanting.robotclub.ab.ca/tiki-index.php">Enchanting</a></b> and
		<b><a href="https://www.open-roberta.org/en/welcome/">OpenRoberta</a></b> are both graphical programming environments compatible
		with the NXT. Enchanting is a cross-platform desktop app based on the excellent <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/">Snap! language</a>,
		which itself is based on the very popular <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch language</a>, and which runs on top of the
		LeJOS firmware. OpenRoberta is a browser-based application which requires constant communication with the NXT to run.

		<br/>
		<b>Platforms</b>: Windows, Mac, Linux (Enchanting); Browser-based (OpenRoberta)

	<h3>Can I control my NXT from a smartphone?</h3>
		<p>
			Yes, using Bluetooth you can connect an NXT to an Android phone, and then use 
			<a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=lego%20nxt&c=apps">any of several</a> third-party apps to control the
			NXT's motors in real time. Unfortunately, due to implementation and certification details, NXTs cannot connect via
			Bluetooth to un-jailbroken iOS devices.
		</p>

	<h3>My NXT Won't Start!</h3>
	<p>
		This is usually caused by one of two things:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Early NXT bricks (shipped in 1.0 and early Education sets) have a hardware bug which causes the screen to fail
				with prolonged use (<a href="https://brickset.com/article/1130/does-your-nxt-have-a-faulty-display">
				more info here</a>). In this case, the NXT will actually start, but if the screen is completely blank and
				the sound has been disabled via the on-brick interface it may appear as if the brick is totally nonresponsive.
			</li>
			<li>
				If something goes wrong during a firmware update, or the firmware is otherwise corrupted, the NXT brick will become
				completely unresponsive. This condition is also characterized by a faint clicking sound which can be heard coming from
				the brick. Fortunately, this problem is easily solvable by following 
				<a href="http://www.legoengineering.com/clicking-brick-syndrome/">this procedue</a>.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<h3>Can an NXT talk to an EV3 over Bluetooth?</h3>
	<p>
		As far as I'm aware, this cannot be easily accomplished using stock firmware and programming environments on both bricks. However,
		both bricks are normal Bluetooth devices, so this is technically possible, and would probably be pretty easy if running something
		like <a href="http://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> on the EV3.

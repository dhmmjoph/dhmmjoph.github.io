<!--<p class="about"><b>John Holbrook</b> is a student, robotics enthusiast, and amateur computer scientist based concurrently in Athens, OH, Huntington, WV, and Orleans, MA, USA.</p>

From 2013 to 2016, John was also a member of the program's 420 race team.</p>

<p class="about">John never thought he would be so pompous as to write a third-person biography of himself, but here he is.</p>-->
 <p class="about">Hi, I'm John. I do lots of things, but these days I'm mostly a student at <a href="http://ohio.edu">Ohio University</a> in Athens, Ohio, where I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Mathematics.</p>

<p class="about">I'm interested in robotics, particularly as an educational tool, and spend some of my time mentoring teams participating in the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST LEGO League</a> and <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/">VEX Robotics Competition</a>, as well as volunteering at FLL and VRC events. My other areas of interest include engineering, physics, 3D printing, and plastering <a href="http://localhost:4000/img/Logo_way_too_big.png">my logo</a> on things. I also play the viola; from 2012 to 2016 I was a member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tsyo1996">Tri-State Youth Orchestra</a>.</p>

<p class="about">In the summer months, I work as an instructor at the  <a href="http://www.orleansyachtclub.org/sailing/junior-sailing-program">Orleans Yacht Club Junior Sailing Program</a> in Orleans, Massachusetts, where I help to instruct children ages 8-18 in sailing, from beginner to advanced levels. I'm particularly interested in advanced boat-handling techniques, race strategy, and applying principles of physics to sailing. From 2012 to 2016, I was also a member of the program's 420 race team. I also sail in the Midwest, as a member of the <a href="https://ohiosailing.com">Ohio University Sailing Team.</a></p>

 <p class="about">I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, where in 2016 I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington_High_School_(West_Virginia)">Huntington High School</a>. While there, I helped found the school's VEX Robotics Competition and Science Olympiad teams.</p>

 <p class="about">There used to be a joke at the end of this bio about how pompous it was to write a bio of oneself in the third person. Now that I've rewritten the bio in the first person, that joke doesn't really fit anymore.</p>

<h2>Accountability though Embarassment</h2>
<p class="about">
	I have a nasty habit of taking too long to update the copyright date at the bottom of every page:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Year</th>
			<th>Date Updated</th>
			<th>Delay</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2016</td>
			<td>July 2</td>
			<td>183 days</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2017</td>
			<td>February 26</td>
			<td>56 days</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2018</td>
			<td>February 8</td>
			<td>39 Days</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	Hopefully I can again beat my personal best score in 2019.
